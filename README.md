# Broken Towns

## About
This program allows a user to sign up, take a picture of broken/malfunctioning
items around a town, and make a complaint to the local municipality responsible
for maintaining the city.

This program allows for users to interact with each other and allows users
to interact with their local works department via an interactive message board.

In addition to uploading pictures, a user can use the interactive google map
to drop "pins" so the city works can know exactly where the broken items are.
The users can additionally see whether or not the city has fixed it, via the
message board.

## The Team
### Andrew Wynard

Andrew set up the Relational Database Service on Amazon Web Service, set up the
S3 bucket for photos on Amazon, and prettied up the front end using CSS.

### Charlie Actor

Charlie set up the Google API for the interactive map, and coordinated AngularJS
on many of the users pages.

### Bryan Roberson

Set up the Java entities, did JUNIT testing, wrote the initial Object Relational
Mapping, and wrote the Login/Authorization.  

### Overall...

We all had a hand in writing the REST API and incorporating front end
technologies(CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, AngularJS).
